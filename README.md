Terra 3d Experiments
====================
I am presently using this repository as a means of showing off some of my experiments with OpenGL in [Terra](http://terralang.org) to friends.  It is not yet ready for public access.  The programs and files herein are incomplete and unlikely to be of use to anyone.

The files with extension .t are Terra files, which Github may not recognize correctly.  They are best viewed with Lua syntax highlighting.  To get Terra, go to [terralang.org](http://terralang.org) or https://github.com/zdevito/terra.
